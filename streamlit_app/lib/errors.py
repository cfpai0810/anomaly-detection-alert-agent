# lib/errors.py: friendly error handling for a non-technical audience

# A business user must never see a Python traceback or an exception name.
# Every failure becomes one plain line that says what went wrong and what to
# do. This covers the Claude calls (bad key, rate limit, network) and any
# unexpected error.
