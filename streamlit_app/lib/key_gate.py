# lib/key_gate.py: the bring-your-own-key gate (foundation component)
# =============================================================================
# Renders the API-key input, holds the key ONLY in session state for the live
# session, and builds a per-session Anthropic client. The key is held in the
# server's memory for that session only: it is never written to disk and
# never logged. This is reused by every tool page.
#
# Honest disclosure (per the master plan): "held in the server's memory for
# your session only, never stored", NOT "never leaves your device", because
# the key does reach the server to make the Claude call. Users who want their
# key to never leave their machine are pointed to the GitHub download.
